Short Bio
===

I am a Phd candidate within the Discrete Technology & Production Automation group and Smart Manufacturing Systems group at the University of Groningen, the Netherlands, since November 2020. I am working with Prof. Jacquelien Scherpen and Prof. Nima Monshizadeh in the project Market design in uncertain power networks. The research project concerns innovative energy operation and management strategies to enhance and promote renewable energy consumption and improve energy efficiency. I received the bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and its Automation in June 2017 and the master's degree in Electrical Engineering in April 2020, both at the North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China. 

Research Interests
===

Power systems are undergoing a significant transition from the traditional model, where large, centralized power plants generate electricity and distribute it across vast regions, to a more decentralized system, where smaller, localized energy sources are increasingly integrated into the grid. While this decentralized structure creates new opportunities for power systems, it also complicates grid management and necessitates the development of new regulatory frameworks and technologies. Given the challenges in decentralized power systems, and by leveraging game theory, operator theory, and control theory, my research focuses on: 

1. Proposing game-theoretic mechanisms to manage and coordinate emerging roles, such as prosumers and aggregators, in decentralized power systems, with the goal of integrating renewable energy resources.

2. Designing distributed and privacy-preserving algorithms with theoretical guarantees to enable the effective deployment of the game-theoretic mechanisms.

For future research, I am interested in developing theoretical results and data-driven methods related to game theory, such as distributionally robust games, Stackelberg games, data-driven equilibrium seeking, data-driven intervention and so on. My goal is to integrate these advancements into solving decision-making problems in power systems.
