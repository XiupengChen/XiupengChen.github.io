Short Bio
===

I am a Phd candidate within the Smart Manufacturing Systems group at the University of Groningen, the Netherlands, since September 2020. I am working with Prof. Nima Monshizadeh and Prof. Jacquelien Scherpen in the project Market design in uncertain power networks. The research project concerns innovative energy operation and management strategies to enhance and promote renewable energy consumption and improve energy efficiency. I received the bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering  and its Automation in June 2017 and the master's degree  in Electrical Engineering in April 2020, both at the North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China.
